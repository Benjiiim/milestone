Milestone clone for self hosted WordPress installations. Counts down to a big event and then displays a message!

== Description ==

This is a clone of the Milestone widget seen on WordPress.com. This uses the same CSS styling and should be more or less functionally equivalent to the plugin. However, this is not the official Milestone plugin.


== Installation ==

*   Install the plugin using your preferred method of choice. Using the built-in WordPress installer is the preferred choice, but you can also do things the hard/manual way by extracting the zip file and droping the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation.</span>

*   Activate Milestone.

*   Add Milestone in the widget area, then configure the date to count down to.</ol>
